         <p> My Name is Brian Kavagi. I am a new programmer at Moringa School. I was born and grew up in Nairobi, I attended Citam Academy Woodley in primary and attained a score of 375 in my KCPE. I then graduated to High School and attained a score of B grade in my KCSE. I currently have no job experience but i'm hopeful to get a job very soon.</p>
         <p> I decided to take a class on programming because I enjoy working with computers and love the  way they can be used to make work easier. I would also like to make the world a better place with the help of computer programming.</p>
         <p> My current interest is to learn programming and how to solve various problems with programming. I enjoy gaming and i'm quite skilled in playing video games, I also enjoy playing football and i'm a supporter of Manchester City football club.</p>
